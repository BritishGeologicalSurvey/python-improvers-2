    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The coding conventions for Python code are written down in [PEP 8 -- Style\n",
    "Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n",
    "PEP8 covers indentation, line lengths, use of whitespace, comments, naming\n",
    "conventions.\n",
    "Following PEP 8 makes your code easier to read and more readily understood by\n",
    "other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example PEP 8 conventions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Variables and functions are written in `snake_case`\n",
    "+ Class names are written in `CamelCase`\n",
    "+ Indent code blocks using 4 spaces\n",
    "+ Use a space around operators e.g. `1 + 1` and after commas e.g. `(1, 2, 3)` \n",
    "\n",
    "The Real Python [How to Write Beautiful Python Code with PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) tutorial gives a nice overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking your code\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many tools for checking if your code conforms to PEP 8 standards.\n",
    "Development environments e.g. Spyder, PyCharm highlight errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line tool `flake8` can be used to check code, too:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "flake8 path/to/my/files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pylint` tool checks PEP 8 as well as highlighting other problems in your\n",
    "code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pylint path/to/my/files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Visual Studio Code, open the Command Palette (\"Ctrl + Shift + P\") and use \"Select Linter\" and \"Run Linting\" commands to analyse your code.\n",
    "In Spyder, pressing \"Source > Run static code analysis (F8)\" will produce\n",
    "a report on your code quality using `flake8` and `pylint`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Run `flake8` against both script files and compare the output.  Fix the `flake8` errors in `plot_climate_data_bad.py`.\n",

    "## What is 'Pythonic' code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonic code uses Python's style conventions and idioms in a way that expresses the programmer's intent in an easily readable and understandable way.\n",
    "This lesson covers both the style conventions and the idioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Pythonic code makes use of features from Python's [Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html) to handle common\n",
    "problems e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ [os](https://realpython.com/working-with-files-in-python/) and [pathlib](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/) modules for navigating the file system\n",
    "+ [csv](https://realpython.com/python-csv/) module for handling comma separated data\n",
    "+ [datetime](https://pymotw.com/2/datetime/) module for handling dates and times\n",
    "+ [re](https://pymotw.com/3/re/) module for text processing with regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the module names above links to a tutorial that gives much more detail than we can in this lesson.\n",
    "It is recommended that you read them all in your own time.\n",
    "We will cover `os` and `pathlib` in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythonic style comes with experience - the more code that you are exposed to, the faster you will learn.\n",
    "Reading tutorials and books, or watching talks from Python conferences on YouTube is a good way to see how code is written.\n",
    "It is also valuable to learn from others by letting them review your code, or by reviewing theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pythonic idioms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python language was designed to be readable.  It doesn't enforce types or the use of classes, or use brackets or semi-colons to break up sections of code.\n",
    "It has many idioms that can be used to write instructions with fewer lines of code than would be required in other langages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following text is copied from [What is Pythonic?](https://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Idioms are frequently not straightforwardly portable from another programming language. For example, the idiomatic way to perform an operation on all items in a list in C looks like this:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ~~~ c\n",
    "> for (i=0; i < mylist_length; i++) {\n",
    ">     do_something(mylist[i]);\n",
    "> }\n",
    "> ~~~\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The direct equivalent in Python would be this:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ~~~ python\n",
    "> i = 0\n",
    "> while i < mylist_length:\n",
    ">     do_something(mylist[i])\n",
    ">     i += 1\n",
    "> ~~~\n",
    ">\n",
    "> That, however, while it works, is not considered Pythonic. It's not an idiom the Python language encourages. We could improve it. A typical idiom in Python to generate all numbers in a list would be to use something like the built-in range() function:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ~~~ python\n",
    "> for i in range(mylist_length):\n",
    ">     do_something(mylist[i])\n",
    "> ~~~\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This is however not Pythonic either. Here is the Pythonic way, encouraged by the language itself:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ~~~ python\n",
    "> for element in mylist:\n",
    ">     do_something(element)\n",
    "> ~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections highlight some common Python idioms.\n",
    "Use these to write Pythonic code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the appropriate collection\n",
    "\n",
    "+ tuple - items (possibly of different types) that belong together, e.g. `('JAS123', 'basalt', dt.date(2025, 12, 9))`\n",
    "+ list - items of the same type that can be added or removed, e.g. `['JAS123', 'JAS124', 'JAS125']`\n",
    "+ dict - key / value store, e.g. `{'id': 'JAS123', 'composition': 'basalt', 'collected': dt.date(2025, 12, 9)}`\n",
    "+ namedtuple - a tuple with named fields, e.g. `sample.id, sample.composition`\n",
    "+ dataclass - even better than a namedtuple: https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple unpacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple unpacking assigns the elements of a tuple (or other iterable) to individual variables in a single line.\n",
    "It is especially useful when processing rows of data returned from a database or CSV file.\n",
    "It can lead to more easily understandable code.\n",
