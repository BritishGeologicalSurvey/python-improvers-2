    "## Virtual environments and dependency management\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python ecosystem consists of the Standard Library, which comes with all Python\n",
    "installations, plus thousands of third-party packages for specialised tasks.\n",
    "Examples of third-party packages are `pandas`, `pytest` and `FastAPI`.\n",
    "They are developed independently of Python itself and to their own schedules, but they\n",
    "depend on Python and also on each other (e.g. `pandas` depends on `matplotlib` and `numpy`).\n",
    "Installed packages are organised in virtual environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python package managers\n",
    "\n",
    "+ pip - official Python tool\n",
    "+ conda / miniconda - good for scientific programming on Windows\n",
    "+ Linux package tooling - stable base for applications on Linux OS\n",
    "+ next-generation tooling based on Rust language (uv, pixi)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a folder that contains a specific set of Python dependencies.\n",
    "\"Activating\" a virtual environment configures the system to look in given folder for Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set up the environment for this course\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done via the Anaconda Navigator application, but it is very slow.\n",
    "Here we use the Anaconda Prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Open Anaconda Prompt.  You should be in `base` environment.\n",
    "+ Run `conda env list` to see existing environments.\n",
    "+ Run `python` to start an interpreter and use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print(sys.executable)\n",
    "print(sys.version)\n",
    "print(sys.path)\n",
    "exit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Create a new virtual environment (this will take a while):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `environment.yml` file lists the specific versions of all the packages that we need.\n",
    "If you are not on a Windows system, or have problems installing the packages, try using `environment_unversioned.yml` instead.\n",
    "This doesn't have pinned versions and only lists the top level packages, so the `conda` solver will choose appropriate versions for your system.\n",
    "Notice the difference in length of the two environment files.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Run `conda env list` to see existing environments.\n",
    "+ Activate the new environment with `conda activate python-improvers-2`\n",
    "+ Run the Python commands above and note the difference\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `conda env export` to create your own `environment.yml`.\n",
    "Copy and paste the results into a file (because on Windows the terminal shell redirect does funny things\n",
    "with the file encoding).\n",
    "This file can be stored in Git alongside your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are packages created and installed?\n",
    "\n",
    "See https://pypistats.org/packages/etlhelper and https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/etlhelper\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supply chain attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Supply chain attacks occur when malicious actors put compromised code into packages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nexus repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sonatype Nexus repository has a Firewall setting that blocks packages that are known to be malicious or that are brand new\n",
    "\n",
    "### Editors\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to run and edit Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Editor/runner|Use case|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|python.exe|Basic command line Python.  Good for executing scripts.|\n",
    "|Spyder|Good for scientific coding and visualisation.  Uses IPython interactive console.|\n",
    "|Jupyter|Good for interactive coding and visualisation.|\n",
    "|VS Code|Good for software development.  Strong linting / autocomplete and integration with Git.|"
