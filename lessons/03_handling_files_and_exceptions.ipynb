    "Reading and writing files is one of the most common tasks in Python and there are several built in tools to help you do this efficiently. The classic way to handle files in Python is using the `os` module, often in combination with the `glob` module for matching filepath patterns. The problem with these modules however, is that they rely on filepaths being represented as strings, which presents its own set of problems when we are working on different operating systems that use different conventions for representing filepaths and directories. For example, Windows uses the backslash to separate directories `\\` whereas Linux uses the forward slash `/`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The more recent addition to standard Python is the **Pathlib** module, which makes handling filepaths easier and provides better interoperabilty between operating systems. Pathlib should be the prefered choice for handling paths, and in this lesson we will demonstrate why.\n",
